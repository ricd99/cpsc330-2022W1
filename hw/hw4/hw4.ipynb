Wait for your submission to run there and examine the autograder results.  If it fails, you are either submitting a wrong file or doing something unexpected somewhere in the code. If you cannot figure it out, make use of office hours and tutorials. It's important that you start early on the assignments so that we help you with such issues.

Use your own judgment in such cases and justify your choices, if necessary._"

    "## Exercise 1: implementing `DummyClassifier`\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "rubric={autograde:10}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course (unlike CPSC 340) you will generally **not** be asked to implement machine learning algorihtms (like logistic regression) from scratch. However, this exercise is an exception: you will implement the simplest possible classifier, `DummyClassifier`.\n",
    " \n",
    "As a reminder, `DummyClassifier` is meant as a baseline and is generally a simple \"model\" you could \"fit\" to a dataset. All it does is predict the most popular class in the training set. So if there are more 0s than 1s it predicts 0 every time, and if there are more 1s than 0s it predicts 1 every time. For `predict_proba` it looks at the frequencies in the training set, so if you have 30% 0's 70% 1's it predicts `[0.3 0.7]` every time. Thus, `fit` only looks at `y` (not `X`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find starter code for a class called `MyDummyClassifier`, which has methods `fit()`, `predict()`, `predict_proba()` and `score()`. Your task is to fill in those four functions. To get your started, I have given you a `return` statement in each case that returns the correct data type: `fit` returns nothing, `predict` returns an array whose size is the number of examples, `predict_proba` returns an array whose size is the number of examples x 2, and `score` returns a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next code block has some tests you can use to assess whether your code is working. \n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest starting with `fit` and `predict`, and making sure those are working before moving on to `predict_proba`. For `predict_proba`, you should return the frequency of each class in the training data, which is the behaviour of `DummyClassifier(strategy='prior')`. Your `score` function should call your `predict` function. Again, you can compare with `DummyClassifier` using the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify this question, you can assume **binary classification**, and furthermore that these classes are **encoded as 0 and 1**. In other words, you can assume that `y` contains only 0s and 1s. The real `DummyClassifier` works when you have more than two classes, and also works if the target values are encoded differently, for example as \"cat\", \"dog\", \"mouse\", etc."

I do want you to know what is going on in `Pipeline` and in `cross_validate` even if we don't cover the details of `fit`.
